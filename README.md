For completing for my Final Project visualization, I start by playing around with the 
datasets that was on features on Kaggle and GitHub called Awesome Public Datasets. This was a 
great starting point for me because I am used to putting these datasets files into Tableau from 
previous assignments to make sense out of the datasets and come up with questions that are 
relevant. There were many datasets that peak my interests. I went from testing various datasets 
such as stock markets and top stock tickers to top 100 of things. I put them into Tableau and play 
around with it to see if these would be good enough to make a great visualization. After many 
attempts back and worth, I landed on Top 100 Biggest Restaurant Chains 2021. This was a data 
from 2020 from top 100 of restaurant chains did best in sales in the US. This peaked my interest 
because after I put these Tableau it had all the components with 7 attributes that most interesting 
to me.
 From this point on, I was able to try various charts ideas and finally landed on the bar 
charts. Because I had an idea to make buttons that would allow me to use same format but data 
for 2 separate charts. Thus, I came up with the idea to create bar charts based on the top 10 
restaurants in terms of sales and total number of units located in the US. I created a bar charts 
with sales numbers in the total billions with a button in green to visualize money. At the same 
time, I was able to create blue button for total amount of units for each restaurant to see if more 
numbers of stores collate to more money in sales. 
From these visualizations, the facts that we can discover from this is that the top 3 units 
of chains are ordered from Subway, Starbucks, and McDonalds’. But the top 3 sales are 
McDonalds’, Starbucks, Chick-fil-A. Subway is all top 7 in sales. Conclusions fact from this 
dataset is that even though Subway has the most stores opened in US, they are performing well 
in terms of sales. McDonald’s beat everyone by a far margin in terms of sales as it doubled 
Starbucks which is the top 2 where McDonald’s generated 40 billion while Starbucks is in the 
top 2 with 20 billion in sales.
